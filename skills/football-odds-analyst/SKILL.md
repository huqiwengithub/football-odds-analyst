# Football Odds Analyst v3.0 — MBI + Pipeline Engine

> **HOW TO USE**: Read KB-2 + KB-4 first for every match. This file = execution flow. references/knowledge-base.md = all rules.
>
> **MBI (Multi-Bookmaker Intelligence)**: Pinnacle (sharp anchor ×0.40) + bet365/IBC (retail ×0.25) + 澳门/皇冠 (Asian ×0.20) + 30-bookmaker dispersion → weighted consensus. **Not just Pinnacle.**

## 🔌 DATA PIPELINE (ALWAYS RUN FIRST)

```
Step 0: Check if {date}_deep.json exists in workspace
  YES → Load and skip to Step 1
  NO  → Check if 500com-football-scraper skill exists
         YES → Invoke 500com-football-scraper with --date {date}
         NO  → Install from marketplace, then invoke
              → Wait for scraper to output JSON
              → Load JSON
```

**Data file spec**: The scraper outputs standardized JSON to the workspace. Key fields: `ouzhi.pinnacle`, `ouzhi.all_bookmakers`, `ouzhi.dispersion`, `yazhi`, `shuju`, `touzhu`, `basic`.

**Note for AI execution**: You are the analyst. When scraper is invoked, it will run in a separate conversation context. It outputs a JSON file to the workspace. Wait for it to complete, then read the JSON and proceed with analysis.

## MBI FRAMEWORK QUICK REFERENCE (Step 3a)

### Bookmaker Tiers (for weighted voting)

| Tier | Weight | Members | Signal |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| Sharp | 0.55 | Pinnacle, bet365, IBC(沙巴) | Highest signal |
| Asian | 0.25 | 澳门, 皇冠, 利记, 易胜博, 12bet | Regional flow |
| Retail | 0.20 | 威廉希尔, 立博, Interwetten, 必发 | Public sentiment |

### Sharp Consensus Score (SCS)

```
For each outcome (H/D/A):
  SCS = Σ(tier_weight_i × direction_i) / Σ(tier_weight_i)
  where direction_i = +1 if odds ↓, -1 if ↑, 0 if unchanged
  
SCS ≥ 0.7 → Strong consensus (+10% to Step 10 correction)
SCS 0.4–0.7 → Moderate (no adjustment)
SCS < 0.4 → Weak consensus (−5% penalty)
```

### Dispersion Risk Index (DRI)

```
DRI = normalized(ouzhi.dispersion.home × 0.5 + ouzhi.dispersion.draw × 0.3 + ouzhi.dispersion.away × 0.2)
Threshold: DRI > 40 → confidence × 0.85
           DRI > 70 → confidence × 0.70 + warning "extreme dispersion"
           DRI < 15 → confidence × 1.05 (tight consensus)
```

### Lead-Lag Chain

```
Pinnacle moves first + bet365 follows <2h + 澳门 follows → STRONG (+10%)
Pinnacle moves + others DON'T follow within 4h → WEAK (ignore movement)
Retail moves first + Pinnacle static → NOISE (ignore)
All three tiers move simultaneously → GENUINE EVENT (+5%)
```

### 4 New MBI Trap Rules (§KB-10)

| # | Rule | Trigger | Signal |
|:--:|------|---------|--------|
| 16 | Tier Divergence | Sharp vs Asian disagree ≥0.25 ball on AH | 🔴 system risk |
| 17 | Exchange-Volume Spike | 必发 volume >2× avg + odds static | Resistance level |
| 18 | Kelly Consensus Gap | Avg Kelly on favorite >1.05 but <0.90 on others | Value signal |
| 19 | Water Flow Anomaly | ≥70% of 16 AH bookmakers move water same direction in <1h | Coordinated move |

## OUTPUT FORMAT

`Read assets/report-template.html` before generating. Core rules:
- W/L PRIMARY, score SECONDARY. Step 9 conclusion at TOP. Red=win, amber=draw, green=loss.
- Chinese names + emoji flags. Prob bars + score cards inline.
- **NEW v3.0**: MBI panel per match showing SCS, DRI, Lead-Lag, Tier Divergence.
- `{{GENERATION_TIME}}` = Beijing. `{{NAME_ERROR_ACTIVE}}` = `active` if English fallback.
- Liquidity grid + external factor table in Step 2.

---

## PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION (unchanged from v2.9)

Rules 1-7 as before. v3.0 adds: if DRI > 40 on any leg, reduce that leg's weight by 30% in allocation.

---

## MIXED PARLAY (same as v2.9)

## BOUNDARIES
- Educational only. No betting advice.
- xG: market-derived base + team form, no Opta/StatsBomb.
- Comply with local laws. Confidence <50% → force warning.
- **Data source**: 500.com native (30 bookmakers). OddsPapi API optional fallback only if 500.com unavailable.
- W/L direction first, score second. Never skip normalization.
